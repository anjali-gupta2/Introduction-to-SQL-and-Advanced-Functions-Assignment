        "Description: A PRIMARY KEY uniquely identifies each record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values. A table can only have one PRIMARY KEY.\n",

        "\n",
        "FOREIGN KEY Constraint:\n",
        "Description: A FOREIGN KEY establishes a link between two tables. It ensures referential integrity by requiring that values in a column (or set of columns) in one table (the referencing table) match values in the PRIMARY KEY of another table (the referenced table).\n",
        "Scenario: Consider an Orders table and a Customers table. The Orders table might have a customer_id column that refers to the customer_id (PRIMARY KEY) in the Customers table. A FOREIGN KEY constraint on customer_id in the Orders table would prevent creating an order for a customer_id that does not exist in the Customers table, thus maintaining the relationship between orders and customers.\n",
        "UNIQUE Constraint:\n",
        "Description: A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a specified column (or set of columns) are distinct across all rows in the table. Unlike a PRIMARY KEY, a table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints, and a column with a UNIQUE constraint can contain NULL values (though only one NULL value is typically allowed, depending on the database system).\n",

        "OFFSET: This clause specifies the number of rows to skip from the beginning of the result set before starting to return rows. It effectively shifts the starting point of the result set. For example, OFFSET 20 would skip the first 20 rows and begin returning results from the 21st row.\n",

        "Main Benefits of CTEs:\n",
        "Improved Readability and Organization: CTEs break down complex queries into smaller, logical, and more manageable units, making the SQL code easier to understand and follow, especially for multi-step data transformations.\n",
        "Reduced Code Duplication: A CTE can be defined once and then referenced multiple times within the same query, eliminating the need to repeat subquery logic.\n",
        "Enhanced Maintainability: By modularizing the query, CTEs simplify debugging and modifications, as changes to a specific logic block are isolated within the CTE definition.\n",
        "Support for Recursive Queries: CTEs are essential for handling hierarchical data structures (e.g., organizational charts, bill of materials) through recursive queries.\n",

        "Second Normal Form (2NF):\n",
        "Definition: A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key. This means that if a primary key is composite (made of multiple columns), no non-key attribute should depend on only a part of that composite key.\n",
        "Example: In a Order_Details table with a composite primary key of (OrderID, ProductID), a ProductName attribute should not be in this table if it only depends on ProductID, not the entire (OrderID, ProductID) combination. ProductName should be in a separate Products table.\n",
        "Third Normal Form (3NF):\n",
        "Definition: A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and there are no transitive dependencies. A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute, rather than directly on the primary key.\n",
        "Example: In a Student table, if DepartmentName is dependent on DepartmentID, and DepartmentID is dependent on StudentID (the primary key), then DepartmentName has a transitive dependency on StudentID. To achieve 3NF, DepartmentName and DepartmentID should be moved to a separate Department table."
